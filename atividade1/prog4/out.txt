Like @ Stone

On @ cobweb @fternoon

In @ room full of emptiness

By @ freew@y I confess

I w@s lost in the p@ges

Of @ book full of de@th

Re@ding how we'll die @lone

@nd if we're good we'll l@y to rest

@nywhere we w@nt to go

In your house I long to be

Room by room p@tiently

I'll w@it for you there

Like @ stone I'll w@it for you there

@lone

On my de@thbed I will pr@y

To the love gods @nd the @ngels

Like @ p@g@n to @nyone

Who will t@ke me to he@ven

To @ pl@ce I rec@ll

I w@s there so long @go

The sky w@s bruised

The wine w@s bled

@nd there you led me on

In your house I long to be

Room by room p@tiently

I'll w@it for you there

Like @ stone I'll w@it for you there

@lone @lone

@nd on I re@d

Until the d@y w@s gone

@nd I s@t in regret

Of @ll the things I've done

For @ll th@t I've blessed

@nd @ll th@t I've wronged

In dre@ms until my de@th

I will w@nder on

In your house I long to be

Room by room p@tiently

I'll w@it for you there

Like @ stone I'll w@it for you there

@lone @lone
