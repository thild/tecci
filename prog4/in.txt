Like A Stone

On a cobweb afternoon

In a room full of emptiness

By a freeway I confess

I was lost in the pages

Of a book full of death

Reading how we'll die alone

And if we're good we'll lay to rest

Anywhere we want to go

In your house I long to be

Room by room patiently

I'll wait for you there

Like a stone I'll wait for you there

Alone

On my deathbed I will pray

To the love gods and the angels

Like a pagan to anyone

Who will take me to heaven

To a place I recall

I was there so long ago

The sky was bruised

The wine was bled

And there you led me on

In your house I long to be

Room by room patiently

I'll wait for you there

Like a stone I'll wait for you there

Alone alone

And on I read

Until the day was gone

And I sat in regret

Of all the things I've done

For all that I've blessed

And all that I've wronged

In dreams until my death

I will wander on

In your house I long to be

Room by room patiently

I'll wait for you there

Like a stone I'll wait for you there

Alone alone
